Quiz Game
This is a simple quiz game that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.

How to play the game
The game will ask the user a series of questions and display the score after each question. The user can enter their answer using the keyboard. If the answer is correct, the score will be incremented by 1. If the answer is incorrect, the score will be decremented by 1. The game will continue until all the questions have been answered.

Customizing the game
You can customize the game by modifying the questions array in the index.js file. Each element of the array should be an object with a question and an answer property, representing the question and the correct answer, respectively.
